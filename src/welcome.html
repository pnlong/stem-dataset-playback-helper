      <p>
        This tool helps musicians record stem-separated datasets.
        It provides click tracks and playback of previously-recorded stems to help each musician
        add their part to the ensemble recording.

        <h3>How the Recording Process Works</h3>
        <p>
          Each instrument in your ensemble will record in a specific order. This order matters because
          later musicians can hear and play along with earlier recordings:
        </p>
        <ol style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 2;">
          <li><strong>First Instrument</strong> records with only the click track</li>
          <li><strong>Second Instrument</strong> records with the click track + playback of the first instrument</li>
          <li><strong>Third Instrument</strong> records with the click track + playback of the first two instruments</li>
          <li>And so on, until all instruments have recorded for every song</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mt-2">
          This layering approach allows each musician to build on what came before, creating a
          cohesive ensemble performance even when recording separately.
